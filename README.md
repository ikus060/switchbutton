Switch Button for SWT (https://www.eclipse.org/swt/)

Originally taken from Opal project (https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/opal/). This is a simplify version of the widget proposed by Opal. It fixes some issue with the drawing in my GTK Linux. I've also introduce keybord listener (key selection and key traversal).
